Exercise 12A: Cryptographic application 
Requirements : 
1. Substitution ciphering (map letter -> cipher) 
2. Encryption and decryption 
3. Cipher is generated randomly 
4. Input data: : cin and/or file 
5. Output data: cout and/ or file 


Exercise 12B: Divisors Finder Requirements: 
1. Generate N random values (int numbers from 0 to M) 
2. Generate all prime numbers from 0 to M 
3. Create a map Prime-> Values , where Prime is a divisor of Value. (eg . 3 -> [6,9] where 6,9 are generated random numbers ) 
4. Input data: N, M (from cin ) 

Use as much STL as possible
